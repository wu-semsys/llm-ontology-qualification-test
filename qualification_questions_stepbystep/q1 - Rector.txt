Section 1: Little Knowledge
This section tests your understanding of basic ontology components
and the ability to recognise them in graphical and textual
representations.
Let's think step by step.
Consider the model, represented in Rector formalisms and answer questions 1 & 2 below.

Rector: PersonTypeA has, amongst other things, some daughters, and some sons, and also only dog pets.
Question:
1. Identify the main model components from the model
- How many named classes can you identify from the model?
- How many relations can you identify from the model?
2. Identifying the different quantifiers from the model
- How many universal restrictions (owl:allValuesFrom) can you
identify in the model?
- How many existential restrictions (owl:someValuesFrom) can you
identify in the model?
