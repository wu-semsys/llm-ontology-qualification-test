Section 1: Little Knowledge
This section tests your understanding of basic ontology components
and the ability to recognise them in graphical and textual
representations.
Let's think step by step.
Consider the model, represented in 3 equivalent formalisms (TTL |
Rector | Warren) and answer questions 1 & 2 below.
TTL:
# –––––––––––––- Class 0––––––––––––-
:PersonTypeA rdf:type owl:Class;
rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty :hasSon;
owl:someValuesFrom :Son
];
rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty :hasDog;
owl:allValuesFrom :Dog
];
rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty :hasDaughter;
owl:someValuesFrom :Daughter
];
rdfs:label "PersonTypeA"@en .
# –––––––––––––- Class 1––––––––––––-
:Son rdf:type owl:Class;
rdfs:label "Son"@en .
# –––––––––––––- Class 2––––––––––––-
:Dog rdf:type owl:Class;
rdfs:label "Dog"@en .
# –––––––––––––- Class 3––––––––––––-
:Daughter rdf:type owl:Class;
rdfs:label "Daughter"@en .
Rector: PersonTypeA has, amongst other things, some daughters, and
some sons, and also only dog pets.
Warren: PersonTypeA has, amongst other things, at least one
daughter, at least one son, and also no other than dog pets.
Question:
1. Identify the main model components from the model
- How many named classes can you identify from the model?
- How many relations can you identify from the model?
2. Identifying the different quantifiers from the model
- How many universal restrictions (owl:allValuesFrom) can you
identify in the model?
- How many existential restrictions (owl:someValuesFrom) can you
identify in the model?
