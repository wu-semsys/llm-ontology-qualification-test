Let's think step by step.
Consider models A and B describing PetLoverTypeD and PerLoverTypeF,
each represented in Rector formalisms and answer question 7 below.
Model A: PetLoverTypeD
Rector: PetLoverTypeD has, amongst other things, some pets that are not Dogs.
Model B: PerLoverTypeF
Rector: PetLoverTypeF has, amongst other things, only Dog pets.
Question 7. Is it true that PetLoverTypeD is disjoint to
PetLoverTypeF? That is, there can be no instance that is at the
same time of type PetLoverTypeD and PetLoverTypeF.
a) Yes
b) No
