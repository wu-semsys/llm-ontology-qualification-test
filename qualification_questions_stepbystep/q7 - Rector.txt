Let's think step by step.
Consider models A and B describing PetLoverTypeG and PerLoverTypeF,
each represented in 3 equivalent formalisms (TTL| Rector | Warren)
and answer question 8 below.
Model A: PetLoverTypeG
Rector: PetLoverTypeG has, amongst other things, only pets that are not Dogs.
Model B: PerLoverTypeF
Rector: PetLoverTypeF has, amongst other things, only Dog pets.
Question 8. Is it true that PetLoverTypeG is disjoint to
PetLoverTypeF? That is, there can be no instance that is at the
same time of type PetLoverTypeG and PetLoverTypeF.
a) Yes
b) No
