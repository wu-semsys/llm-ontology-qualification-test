Section 3: Expert Knowledge
This section tests your ability to reason with ontology models, as
well as compare and relate them to each other.
Let's think step by step.
Consider models A and B both describing PetLoverTypeE, each
represented in 3 equivalent formalisms (TTL | Rector | Warren)
and answer question 6 below.
Model A: PetLoverTypeE
TTL:
# –––––––––––––- Class 0––––––––––––-

rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;

rdfs:domain :PetLoverTypeE;
rdfs:range [ rdf:type owl:Class;
owl:unionOf ( :Dog :Cat )

Rector: PetLoverTypeE has, amongst other things, some Cat pets and
some Dog pets and also only Cat and Dog pets.
Warren: PetLoverTypeE has, amongst other things, at least one Cat
pet and at least one Dog pet and also no other than Cat and Dog
pets.
Model B: PetLoverTypeE
TTL:
# –––––––––––––- Class 0––––––––––––-
:PetLoverTypeE rdf:type owl:Class;
rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty :hasPet;
owl:someValuesFrom :Dog

rdfs:subClassOf [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
owl:onProperty :hasPet;
owl:someValuesFrom :Cat
];
rdfs:label "PetLoverTypeE"@en .
# –––––––––––––- Class 1––––––––––––-
:Dog rdf:type owl:Class;
rdfs:label "Dog"@en .
# –––––––––––––- Class 2––––––––––––-
:Cat rdf:type owl:Class;
rdfs:label "Cat"@en .
Rector: PetLoverTypeE has, amongst other things, some Cat pets and
some Dog pets.
Warren: PetLoverTypeE has, amongst other things, at least one Cat
pet and at least one Dog pet.
Question 6. Select the correct statement about models A and B
describing PetLoverTypeE.
a) Model A allows for instances of PetLoverTypeE to have a pet that
is neither a Dog nor a Cat.
b) Model B allows for instances of PetLoverTypeE to have a pet that
is neither a Dog nor a Cat.
c) None of the models allow for instances of PetLoverTypeE to have a
pet that is neither a Dog nor a Cat.
d) Both models allow for instances of PetLoverTypeE to have a pet
that is neither a Dog nor a Cat.
